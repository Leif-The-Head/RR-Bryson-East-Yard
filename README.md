#### Railroader Mod
# Bryson East Yard

Adds an 8-track flat stub yard after the east yard lead of Bryson.

The yard is built through a three-step progression, each requiring quite a number of cars (Convenience ain't cheap!).

Compatible to my carve-out of [the Cottonworks](https://github.com/Leif-The-Head/T-cave-s-Cottonworks) from T-cave's Machining and Manufacturing.

## Installation
This is a [Railloader Mod](https://railroader.stelltis.ch/), and as such requires Railloader itself and follows the standard Railloader installation way.

### Requirements
- [Zamu's Strange Customs](https://railroader.stelltis.ch/mods/strange-customs)
- [AlinaNova's MapMod](https://railroader.alinanova.dev/) (progressions)

### Conflicts
- T-cave's Machining and Manufacturing (original version)
- [PrinceOfPluto's Bryson Hump Yard](https://www.nexusmods.com/railroader/mods/120/) (same place, same track count, has an additional hump. This is basically an alternative)
